# Football Squares

## About

I build things for fun!

It's an app that tracks the football squares game. People's bets and their smack talk.

Definitely a work in progress, but also a playground for me to explore new technology.

It's a basic CRUD app, but with some fun stuff. like a hot reloading golang backend inside of a docker container.

## Roadmap

- Build out more routes
- explore WASM
- client side work in general (this would be an _epic_)
- CI/CD
- GCP integration
